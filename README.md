In the proposed project, heterogeneous teams of autonomous robots will be utilized to achieve a common goal. The robots we used were two kinds: a robotic arm and a turtlebot3. </br>
We use PDDL to plan a set of steps the robots can take to get from their initial state to their goal state, in fewer actions.
